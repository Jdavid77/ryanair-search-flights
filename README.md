# ✈️ Ryanair Flight Search App

> *"I wanted to build a flight search app, but I'm too lazy to actually code it myself, so I made Claude do all the work while I pretended to be a developer."* - João

## 🤔 What is this?

This is a Django-powered flight search application that uses `ryanair-py` package to scrape Ryanair's website to find you those sweet budget flights.

**Fun fact**: The entire codebase was written by an AI while I sat there and occasionally typed "make it work" into the chat. F*ck even this ReadMe was AI
